## Errors having to do with unavailable APIs or language features:

scala/text/Document.scala
# Lots of type errors for pattern matches, having to do with the fact
# that Document contains a :: method without corresponding extractor,
# but still wants to extract lists using ::. We won't support that.
# Since Document should have been removed already, let's ignore it.
