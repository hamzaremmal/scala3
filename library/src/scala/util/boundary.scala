/** A boundary that can be exited by `break` calls.
 *  `boundary` and `break` represent a unified and superior alternative for the
 *  `scala.util.control.NonLocalReturns` and `scala.util.control.Breaks` APIs.
 *  The main differences are:
 *
 *    - Unified names: `boundary` to establish a scope, `break` to leave it.
 *      `break` can optionally return a value.
 *    - Integration with exceptions. `break`s are logically non-fatal exceptions.
 *      The `Break` exception class extends `ControlException` which is a regular
 *      `RuntimeException`, optimized so that stack trace generation is suppressed.
 *    - Better performance: breaks to enclosing scopes in the same method can
 *      be rwritten to jumps.
