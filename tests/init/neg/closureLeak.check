   |Could not verify that the method argument is transitively initialized (Hot). It was found to be a function { this = the original object of type "class Outer" that started this trace, owner = class Outer }. Only transitively initialized arguments may be passed to methods outside the analyzed initialization region. Calling trace:
   |-> class Outer {	[ closureLeak.scala:1 ]

   |Promoting the value to transitively initialized (Hot) failed due to the following problem:
