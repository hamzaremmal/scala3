title: "Extension Methods"
---

Extension methods allow one to add methods to a type after the type is defined. Example:

```scala
case class Circle(x: Double, y: Double, radius: Double)

implicit object CircleOps {
  def circumference(this c: Circle): Double = c.radius * math.Pi * 2
}
```

`CircleOps` adds an extension method `circumference` to values of class `Circle`. Like regular methods, extension methods can be invoked with infix `.`:

```scala
  val circle = Circle(0, 0, 1)
  circle.circumference
```

Extension methods are methods that have a `this` modifier for the first parameter.
They can also be invoked as plain methods. So the following holds:
```scala
assert(circle.circumference == CircleOps.circumference(circle))
```



### Translation of Calls to Extension Methods

When is an extension method considered? There are two possibilities. The first (and recommended one) is by defining the extension method as a member of an implicit value. The method can then be used as an extension method wherever the implicit value is applicable. The second possibility is by making the extension method itself visible under a simple name, typically by importing it. As an example, consider an extension method `longestStrings` on `String`. We can either define it like this:


```scala
implicit object StringSeqOps1 {
  def longestStrings(this xs: Seq[String]) = {
    val maxLength = xs.map(_.length).max
    xs.filter(_.length == maxLength)
  }
}
```
Then
```scala
List("here", "is", "a", "list").longestStrings
```
is legal everywhere `StringSeqOps1` is available as an implicit value. Alternatively, we can define `longestStrings`
as a member of a normal object. But then the method has to be brought into scope to be usable as an extension method.

```scala
implicit object StringSeqOps2{
  def longestStrings(this xs: Seq[String]) = {
    val maxLength = xs.map(_.length).max
    xs.filter(_.length == maxLength)
  }
}
import StringSeqOps2.longestStrings
List("here", "is", "a", "list").longestStrings
```
The precise rules for resolving a selection to an extension method are as follows.

Assume a selection `e.m[Ts]` where `m` is not a member of `e`, where the type arguments `[Ts]` are optional,
and where `T` is the expected type. The following two rewritings are tried in order:

 1. The selection is rewritten to `m[Ts](e)`.
 2. If the first rewriting does not typecheck with expected type `T`, and there is an implicit value `i`
    in either the current scope or in the implicit scope of `T`, and `i` defines an extension
    method named `m`, then selection is expanded to `i.m[Ts](e)`.
    This second rewriting is attempted at the time where the compiler also tries an implicit conversion
    from `T` to a type containing `m`. If there is more than one way of rewriting, an ambiguity error results.

So `circle.circumference` translates to `CircleOps.circumference(circle)`, provided
`circle` has type `Circle` and `CircleOps` is an eligible implicit (i.e. it is visible at the point of call or it is defined in the companion object of `Circle`).

### Generic Extensions

The `StringSeqOps` examples extended a specific instance of a generic type. It is also possible
to extend a generic type by adding type parameters to an extension method:

```scala
implicit object ListOps {
  def second[T](this xs: List[T]) = xs.tail.head
}
```

or:


```scala
implicit object ListListOps {
  def flattened[T](this xs: List[List[T]]) = xs.foldLeft[List[T]](Nil)(_ ++ _)
}
```

As usual, type parameters of the extension method follow the defined method name. Nevertheless, such type parameters can already be used in the parameter clause that precedes the defined method name.

### A Larger Example

As a larger example, here is a way to define constructs for checking arbitrary postconditions using `ensuring` so that the checked result can be referred to simply by `result`. The example combines opaque aliases, implicit function types, and extensions to provide a zero-overhead abstraction.

```scala
object PostConditions {
  opaque type WrappedResult[T] = T

  private object WrappedResult {
    def wrap[T](x: T): WrappedResult[T] = x
    def unwrap[T](x: WrappedResult[T]): T = x
  }

  def result[T](implicit er: WrappedResult[T]): T = WrappedResult.unwrap(er)

  implicit object Ensuring {
    def ensuring[T](this x: T)(condition: implicit WrappedResult[T] => Boolean): T = {
      implicit val wrapped = WrappedResult.wrap(x)
      assert(condition)
      x
    }
  }
}

object Test {
  import PostConditions._
  val s = List(1, 2, 3).sum.ensuring(result == 6)
}
```
**Explanations**: We use an implicit function type `implicit WrappedResult[T] => Boolean`
as the type of the condition of `ensuring`. An argument condition to `ensuring` such as
`(result == 6)` will therefore have an implicit value of type `WrappedResult[T]` in scope
to pass along to the `result` method. `WrappedResult` is a fresh type, to make sure that we do not get unwanted implicits in scope (this is good practice in all cases where implicit parameters are involved). Since `WrappedResult` is an opaque type alias, its values need not be boxed, and since `ensuring` is added as an extension method, its argument does not need boxing either. Hence, the implementation of `ensuring` is as about as efficient as the best possible code one could write by hand:

    { val result = List(1, 2, 3).sum
      assert(result == 6)
      result
    }

### Rules for Overriding Extension Methods

Extension methods may override only extension methods and can be overridden only by extension methods.

### Extension Methods and TypeClasses

The rules for expanding extension methods make sure that they work seamlessly with typeclasses. For instance, consider `SemiGroup` and `Monoid`.
```scala
  // Two typeclasses:
  trait SemiGroup[T] {
    def combine(this x: T)(y: T): T
  }
  trait Monoid[T] extends SemiGroup[T] {
    def unit: T
  }

  // An instance declaration:
  implicit object StringMonoid extends Monoid[String] {
    def combine(this x: String)(y: String): String = x.concat(y)
    def unit: String = ""
  }

  // Abstracting over a typeclass with a context bound:
  def sum[T: Monoid](xs: List[T]): T =
    xs.foldLeft(implicitly[Monoid[T]].unit)(_.combine(_))
```
In the last line, the call to `_.combine(_)` expands to `(x1, x2) => x1.combine(x2)`,
which expands in turn to `(x1, x2) => ev.combine(x1, x2)` where `ev` is the implicit
evidence parameter summoned by the context bound `[T: Monoid]`. This works since
extension methods apply everywhere their enclosing object is available as an implicit.

### Generic Extension Classes

As another example, consider implementations of an `Ord` type class with a `minimum` value:
```scala
  trait Ord[T] {
    def compareTo(this x: T)(y: T): Int
    def < (this x: T)(y: T) = x.compareTo(y) < 0
    def > (this x: T)(y: T) = x.compareTo(y) > 0
    val minimum: T
  }

  implicit object IntOrd extends Ord[Int] {
    def compareTo(this x: Int)(y: Int) =
      if (x < y) -1 else if (x > y) +1 else 0
    val minimum = Int.MinValue
  }

  implicit class ListOrd[T: Ord] extends Ord[List[T]] {
    def compareTo(this xs: List[T])(ys: List[T]): Int = (xs, ys) match {
      case (Nil, Nil) => 0
      case (Nil, _) => -1
      case (_, Nil) => +1
      case (x :: xs1, y :: ys1) =>
        val fst = x.compareTo(y)
        if (fst != 0) fst else xs1.compareTo(ys1)
    }
    val minimum: List[T] = Nil
  }

  def max[T: Ord](x: T, y: T): T = if (x < y) y else x

  def max[T: Ord](xs: List[T]): T = (implicitly[Ord[T]].minimum /: xs)(max(_, _))
```
The `ListOrd` class is generic - it works for any type argument `T` that is itself an instance of `Ord`. In current Scala, we could not define `ListOrd` as an implicit class since implicit classes can only define implicit converions that take exactly one non-implicit value parameter. We propose to drop this requirement and to also allow implicit classes without any value parameters, or with only implicit value parameters. The generated implicit method would in each case follow the signature of the class. That is, for `ListOrd` we'd generate the method:
```scala
  implicit def ListOrd[T: Ord]: ListOrd[T] = new ListOrd[T]
```

### Higher Kinds

Extension methods generalize to higher-kinded types without requiring special provisions. Example:

```scala
  trait Functor[F[_]] {
    def map[A, B](this x: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
  }

  trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
    def flatMap[A, B](this x: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]
    def map[A, B](this x: F[A])(f: A => B) = x.flatMap(f `andThen` pure)

    def pure[A](x: A): F[A]
  }

  implicit object ListMonad extends Monad[List] {
    def flatMap[A, B](this xs: List[A])(f: A => List[B]): List[B] =
      xs.flatMap(f)
    def pure[A](x: A): List[A] =
      List(x)
  }

  implicit class ReaderMonad[Ctx] extends Monad[[X] => Ctx => X] {
    def flatMap[A, B](this r: Ctx => A)(f: A => Ctx => B): Ctx => B =
      ctx => f(r(ctx))(ctx)
    def pure[A](x: A): Ctx => A =
      ctx => x
  }
```
### Syntax

The required syntax extension just adds one clause for extension methods relative
to the [current syntax](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/blob/master/docs/docs/internals/syntax.md).
```
DefSig          ::=  id [DefTypeParamClause] [ExtParamClause] DefParamClauses
ExtParamClause  ::=  [nl] ‘(’ ‘this’ DefParam ‘)’
```
